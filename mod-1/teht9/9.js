/*Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number. (2p)

    Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and itself.
    For example, number 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.
    On the other hand, number 21 for example is not a prime number as it can be also be divided by numbers 3 and 7.
    Print the result on the HTML document. */
